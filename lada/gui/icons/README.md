After adding a new icon you have to include it in `resources.gresource.xml` and compile it to create a new version
of `resources.gresource` with the command `glib-compile-resources resources.gresource.xml`

If possible use GNOME icons. Easiest way to do that is using  https://flathub.org/en/apps/org.gnome.design.IconLibrary
